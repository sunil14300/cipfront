CipherStudio: A Full-Stack Browser-Based React IDE

Project Overview

CipherStudio is a browser-based, dark-themed online code editor built to simulate a modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE) environment. Users can create projects, manage multiple files (.js, .html, .css), edit code in a professional CodeMirror environment, and see the live output rendered in real-time.

This project was built following the specifications outlined in the CipherSchools Full Stack Assignment, focusing on robust file persistence (MongoDB/Express) and a highly professional user experience (Tailwind CSS, Autosave).

Key Features Implemented

Core Functionality: Create, load, and manage projects with a unique ID.

File Management: Create, rename, and delete multiple files (.html, .js, .css) within a project.

Real-Time Preview: Live rendering of the project output as code is typed.

Code Editor: Rich editing experience powered by CodeMirror with syntax highlighting and a dark theme.

Autosave (Bonus Feature): Changes are debounced and automatically saved to the backend API every 800ms, providing a seamless, worry-free editing experience.

Save Status: Visual feedback ("Unsaved changes...", "Saving...", "Saved") is provided to the user.

Professional UI/UX: A high-contrast, dark-mode design implemented using Tailwind CSS for a modern IDE feel.

LLM Integration: Backend endpoint is configured to interact with the OpenAI API for code generation (accessible via a future UI implementation).

Setup and Installation

This repository assumes a monorepo structure, with separate frontend and backend directories.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v18+)

MongoDB Instance (Local or MongoDB Atlas)

OpenAI API Key

1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory.

Install dependencies: npm install

Create a file named .env and configure it:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/cipherstudio?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY


Start the server: npm start (or npm run dev if configured)
The server will run on http://localhost:5000.

2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory.

Install dependencies: npm install

Create a file named .env and configure the API URL:

# CRITICAL: This must point to the backend's address and port
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api 


Start the client application: npm start
The client will run on http://localhost:3000 (or the next available port).

Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for production deployment on modern hosting platforms.
